### Hello, I'm Chrys! 👋

I'm a designer with a passion for solving problems and turning complex problems into intuitive solutions.

* ✨ Today, I am eager to transition into web development and focus on not only web design but also building impactful and meaningful digital experiences for users.
* 🌱 I am currently working on expanding my knowledge and improving my proficiency in Javascript & React.
* 🤓 I'm eager to dive into Storybook next and use it in my React projects.
* 🐱‍🏍 I want to learn more about optimising CSS and SVG animations for performance.
* 🤟🏻 I'm a huge fan of Tailwind CSS!
